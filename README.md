# ComputationalComplexity
In theoretical computing science, evaluating the time complexity of algorithms is tedious and time-consuming, and there is currently no unified method. We proposes an evaluation method to simplify the computation of time complexity.


$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "youremail@example.com"
ssh-add "private key"
ssh git@github.com
git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
